you feel like you just wanna just give up\n[00:43.235]\n[00:43.239] But you gotta search within you, try and find that inner strength\n[00:46.990]\n[00:46.999] And just pull that shit out of you, and get that motivation not to give up\n[00:51.340]\n[00:51.349] And not be a quitter no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face.\n[00:55.090]\n[00:55.290] \n[00:55.729] Till I collapse I'm spillin' these\n[00:57.490] raps long as you feel 'em\n[00:58.439] Till the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em\n[01:01.880]\n[01:01.890] Cuz when I am not, then I'ma stop pinnin' them and I am not\n[01:04.200] \n[01:04.209] hip-hop and I'm not just Eminem\n[01:06.429] Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin'\n[01:09.329] 'em, women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom\n[01:12.540]\n[01:12.549] Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not\n[01:14.759] Get the illin' to stop, amoxacillin's just not real enough\n[01:17.659] The criminal cop killin' hip-hop villiana\n[01:20.769] Minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners\n[01:23.609] Your comin' with me, feel it or not you're gonna fear it\n[01:26.239] Like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us\n[01:29.390] You hear it a lot lyrics to shock,\n[01:31.509] Is it a miracle\n[01:32.679] Or am I just a product of pop fizzin' up?\n[01:34.929] Fa shizzel my wizzel, this is the plot\n[01:36.769] Listen up,\n[01:39.090] You bizzels forgot slizzel does not give a ****\n[01:40.319]\n[01:40.999] Till the roof comes off,\n[01:41.929] Till the lights go out\n[01:43.690] Till my leg give out\n[01:44.079] Can't shut my mouth\n[01:45.499] Till the smoke clears out\n[01:47.690] And my high burn out\n[01:48.289] I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse\n[01:51.390] Till the roof comes off\n[01:52.539] Till the lights go out\n[01:54.009] Till my legs give out\n[01:55.339] Can't shut my mouth\n[01:57.700] Till the smoke clears out\n[01:58.079] Am I high, perhaps?\n[01:59.449] I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse\n[02:02.319]\n[02:02.609] \n[02:02.929] Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin'\n[02:05.600] You get when you're real,\n[02:06.410] And you spit and people are feelin' ya shit\n[02:07.899] This is your moment and every single minute\n[02:10.249] You spend trynna hold on to it\n[02:11.520] 'cuz you may never get it again\n[02:13.279] So while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can\n[02:16.100] And when your run is over\n[02:17.290] Just admit when it's at its end\n[02:18.950] 'Cuz I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit gets in\n[02:21.660] I got a list\n[02:22.720] Here's the order of my list that it's in -\n[02:24.689] It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie\n[02:27.330] Andre from Outkast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me\n[02:30.279] But in this industry, I'm the cause of a lotta\n[02:32.439] Envy\n[02:33.700] So when I'm not put on this list\n[02:34.439] The shit does not offend me\n[02:35.800] That's why you see me walkin' around like nothin's\n[02:37.760] Botherin' me, even though half\n[02:39.459] You people gotta ****in' problem with me\n[02:41.230] You hate it but you know respect you got to\n[02:43.730] Give me\n[02:44.459] The press' wet dream like\n[02:45.470] Bobby and Whitney\n[02:46.510] Nate hit me\n[02:47.330]\n[02:47.550]\n[02:48.200] Chorus: Till the roof comes off,\n[02:48.990] Till the lights go out\n[02:49.689] Till my leg give out\n[02:50.999] Can't shut my mouth\n[02:52.420] Till the smoke clears out\n[02:53.629] And my high burn out\n[02:55.070] I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse\n[02:56.600] Till the roof comes off\n[02:59.420] Till the lights go out\n[03:00.899] Till my legs give out\n[03:01.999] Can't shut my mouth\n[03:03.490] Till the smoke clears out\n[03:05.300] Am I high, perhaps?\n[03:06.700] I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse\n[03:08.929]\n[03:09.540] \n[03:10.499] Soon as a verse starts I eat at an Emcee's\n[03:11.309] Heart, what is he thinkin', how\n[03:13.360] Not to go against me, smart\n[03:14.800] And it's absurd how people hang on every word\n[03:17.350] I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve\n[03:20.700] But I'll never be served, my\n[03:21.580] Spot is forever reserved\n[03:23.040] If I ever leave Earth\n[03:24.429] That would be the death of me first\n[03:25.929] 'cuz in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could\n[03:28.399] Ever be worse that's why I'm\n[03:29.890] Clever when I put together every verse\n[03:31.470] My thoughts are sporadic, I act like\n[03:33.629] I'm an addict\n[03:34.640] I rap like I'm addicted to smack,\n[03:36.379] Like I'm Kim Mathers\n[03:37.379] But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles\n[03:40.080] The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers\n[03:42.740] So this is like a full blown attack I'm launchin'\n[03:45.390] On them, the track is on some\n[03:46.929] Battlin' rap who wants some static\n[03:48.360] 'Cuz I don't really think that the fact that\n[03:50.209] I'm Slim matters\n[03:51.379] A plague and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest so\n[03:54.010]\n[03:54.240]\n[03:54.459] Till the roof comes off,\n[03:55.309] Till the lights go out\n[03:56.520] Till my leg give out\n[03:58.300] Can't shut my mouth\n[03:59.209] Till the smoke clears out\n[04:00.580] And my high burn out\n[04:02.800] I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse\n[04:04.920] Till the roof comes off\n[04:06.990] Till the lights go out\n[04:07.779] Till my legs give out\n[04:09.040] Can't shut my mouth\n[04:10.510] Till the smoke clears out\n[04:13.090] Am I high, perhaps?\n[04:13.280] I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse\n[04:16.890]\n[04:17.730] Until the roof, (Until the roof)\n[04:19.720] the roof comes off (The roof comes off)\n[04:21.600] Until my legs, (Until my legs)\n[04:23.800] give out from underneath me,\n[04:28.230] I, I will not fall,\n[04:32.900] I will stand tall\n[04:34.970] Feels like no one can\n[04:38.500] beat me\n[08:19.699]", "Comments": 2977, "Mp3Url":
