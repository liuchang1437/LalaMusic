Hey hey hey!\n[00:17.280]\n[00:18.640] She was such a pretty girl, \n[00:21.800]With glowing eyes and yellow curls. Hey hey hey!\n[00:26.800]\n[00:27.660] Stars are in a summer night,\n[00:29.760] She's wishing that they'd fall down through the atmosphere, \n[00:33.160]For a souvenir.\n[00:36.600] She's waiting for her Superman, her Never land,\n[00:39.380] Cause he can show the way.
