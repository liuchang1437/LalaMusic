things may not always make sense to you right now\n[00:10.599]But hey, what daddy always tell you?\n[00:14.259]Straighten up little soldier\n[00:16.670]Stiffen up that upper lip\n[00:19.500]What you crying about?\n[00:22.100]\n[00:22.200]You got me\n[00:22.630]Hailie I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad\n[00:25.480]Well I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had\n[00:28.540]I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh\n[00:31.570]I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry\n[00:34.290]Cuz you're scared, I ain't there?\n[00:35.709]Daddy's with you in your prayers\n[00:37.990]No more crying, wipe them tears\n[00:38.470]Daddy's here, no more nightmares\n[00:39.919]We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do

swirls\n[00:49.000]When it whirls, when it twirls\n[00:49.809]Two little beautiful girls\n[00:51.269]Lookin' puzzled, in a daze\n[00:52.589]I know it's confusing you\n[00:54.990]Daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news\n[00:56.820]I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems\n[00:59.500]The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me\n[01:02.120]All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see\n[01:05.300]Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did\n[01:07.980]We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me\n[01:10.490]But things have gotten so bad between us\n[01:12.899]I don't see us ever being together ever again\n[01:15.000]Like we used to be when we was teenagers\n[01:16.720]But then of course everything always happens for a reason\n[01:19.630]I guess it was never meant to be\n[01:21.450]But it's just something we have no control\n[01:23.260]over and that's what destiny is\n[01:25.110]But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep\n[01:27.619]Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream\n[01:30.649]Now hush little baby, don't you cry\n[01:30.800]\n[01:33.899]Everything's gonna be alright\n[01:35.800]Stiffen that upperlip up little lady, i told ya\n[01:38.570]Daddy's here to hold ya through the night\n[01:42.200]I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why\n[01:44.779]We feel how we feel inside\n[01:46.740]It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby\n[01:49.450]But i promise momma's gon' be alright\n[01:52.140]\n[01:52.589]It's funny\n[01:53.500]I remember back one year when daddy had no money\n[01:55.860]Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up\n[01:57.610]And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me\n[02:00.220]Cuz daddy couldn't buy 'em\n[02:01.619]I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying\n[02:04.420]Cuz daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job\n[02:07.800]But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom\n[02:09.919]And at the time every house that we lived in\n[02:12.300]Either kept getting broke into and robbed\n[02:15.190]Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar\n[02:18.449]Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college\n[02:21.210]Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it\n[02:24.460]And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart\n[02:27.300]And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart\n[02:29.930]Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back\n[02:32.909]On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment\n[02:35.728]And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara\n[02:38.259]And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre\n[02:42.300]And flew you and momma out to see me\n[02:44.199]But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me\n[02:46.780]Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it\n[02:50.170]And you and Laney were to young to understand it\n[02:52.770]Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit\n[02:55.610]And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it\n[02:59.190]I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand\n[03:01.900]Cuz all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud\n[03:03.830]Now I'm sittin in this empty house, just reminiscing\n[03:06.930]Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out\n[03:09.199]To see how much you both have grown,\n[03:10.590]it's almost like you're sisters now\n[03:12.409]Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here\n[03:15.620]Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here\n[03:18.440]I like the sound of that, yeah\n[03:19.889]It's got a ring to it don't it?\n[03:21.490]Shh, momma's only gone for the moment\n[03:23.259]\n[03:23.629]Now hush little baby, don't you cry\n[03:26.490]Everything's gonna be alright\n[03:28.300]Stiffen that upperlip up little lady, i told ya\n[03:31.430]Daddy's here to hold ya through the night\n[03:33.970]I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why\n[03:37.659]We feel how we feel inside\n[03:39.620]It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby\n[03:42.790]But i promise momma's gon' be alright\n[03:45.789]\n[03:46.790]Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird\n[03:46.900]And if you ask me too\n[03:49.400]I'mma give you the world\n[03:50.920]I'mma buy a diamond ring for you\n[03:52.759]I'mma sing for you\n[03:53.740]I'll do anything for you to see you smile\n[03:56.819]And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine\n[04:00.110]I'mma break that birdies neck\n[04:02.150]I'd go back to the jewler who sold it to ya\n[04:04.970]And
