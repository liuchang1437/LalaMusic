It calls me\n[00:54.62]And no one knows, how far it goes\n[01:01.00]If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me\n[01:05.92]One day I'll know, if I go there's just no telling how far I'll go\n[01:13.23]I know everybody on this island, seems so happy on this island\n[01:19.85]Everything is by design\n[01:24.23]I know everybody on this island has a role on this island\n[01:31.13]So maybe I can roll with mine\n[01:35.29]I can lead with pride, I can make us strong\n[01:38.04]I'll be satisfied if I play along\n[01:40.94]But the voice inside sings a different song\n[01:43.85]What is wrong with me?\n[01:49.56]See the light as it shines on the sea? It's blinding\n[01:54.70]But no one knows, how deep it goes\n[02:00.97]And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me\n[02:05.97]And let me know, what's beyond that line, will I cross that line?\n[02:12.56]See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me\n[02:17.59]And no one knows, how far it goes\n[02:23.74]If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me\n[02:28.85]One day I'll know, how far I'll go", "Comments": 1359, "Mp3Url": "https://m8.music.126.net/20170619023059/2d3d064b7908b0ca732f4a212b0fd2a7/ymusic/073e/270d/3f46/613d78ae14183ce25774862ae94a4845.mp3", "AlbumPic": "https://p1.music.126.net/s0RHi6Oz0WshynpTZHezyQ==/2946691245586885.jpg"}
