R U?... Oh, OK.\"\n[03:00.46] (Drew) There are moments when I don't know if it's real\n[03:05.38] Or if anybody feels the way I feel\n[03:10.43] I need inspiration\n[03:14.51] Not just another negotiation\n[03:20.74] (Both) All I wanna to do is find a way back into love\n[03:30.06] I can't make it through without a way back into love\n[03:37.49] And if I open my heart to you\n[03:42.05] I'm hoping you'll show me what to do\n[03:46.75] And if you help me to start again\n[03:52.23] You know that I'll be there for you in the end\n[03:59.73]", "Comments": 20201, "Mp3Url": "https://m8.music.126.net/20170619112158/998240c800489fc0f70b727783fa0aeb/ymusic/521f/ffa4/19cf/5f2f0ddfcc21b87f9f568372a7e064c5.mp3", "AlbumPic": "https://p1.music.126.net/_WLFR2EDo0UN1jJE6UxOTg==/6659741930159840.jpg"}
