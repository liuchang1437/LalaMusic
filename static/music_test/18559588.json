I'm more than a plane\nMore than some pretty face beside a train\nIt's not easy to be me\n\nWish that I could cry\nFall upon my knees\nFind a way to lie\nAbout a home I'll never see\n\nIt may sound absurd... But don't be naive\nEven heroes have the right to bleed\nI may be disturbed... But won't you concede\nEven heroes have the right to dream\nIt's not easy to be me\n\nUp, up and away... Away from me\nBut it's all right.... You can all sleep sound tonight\nI'm not crazy... Or anything...\n\nI can't stand to fly\nI'm not that naive\nMen weren't meant to ride\nWith clouds between their knees\n\nI'm only a man in a silly red sheet\nDigging for kryptonite on this one way street\nOnly a man in a funny red sheet\nLooking for special things inside of me\nInside of me Inside me\nYeah, Inside me  Inside of me\n\nI'm only a man\nIn a funny red sheet\nI'm only a man\nLooking for a dream\nI'm only a man\nIn a funny red sheet\nAnd it's not easy, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm...\n\nIt's not easy to be me", "Comments": 203, "Mp3Url": "https://m8.music.126.net/20170620055332/861e06effb6cba338a291950bc323704/ymusic/678e/bc6d/c645/87eb47bf460b533f603787fd18f165ce.mp3", "AlbumPic": "https://p1.music.126.net/oEzptKfT-_VgQ-jN48NXjw==/2537672837268189.jpg"}
