stand\n[00:05.190](It's been a ride)\n[00:06.550]Everybody, everybody\n[00:07.750](I guess I had to)\n[00:09.260]Come take my hand, come take my hand\n[00:10.910](Go to that place to get to this one)\n[00:11.950]We'll walk this world together through the storm\n[00:13.280](Now some of you)\n[00:14.710]Whatever weather, cold or warm\n[00:15.530](Might still be in that place)\n[00:17.810]Just lettin' you know that you're not alone\n[00:18.480](If you're tryin' to get out)\n[00:20.790]Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road\n[00:21.210](Just follow me, I'll get you there)\n[00:23.480]You can try read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em\n[00:26.340]But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em\n[00:27.960]'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causing mayhem\n[00:35.390]When I say I'ma do something, I do it, I don't give a damn what you think\n[00:37.280]I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world\n[00:38.290]Feed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stopping me\n[00:40.370]I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably\n[00:43.590]And all those who look down on me, I'm tearing down your balcony\n[00:46.290]No if, ands, or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he\n[00:49.030]From \"Infinite\" down to that last \"Relapse\" album\n[00:52.210]He's still shittin' whether he's on salary, paid hourly\n[00:54.320]Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him\n[00:58.230]Whichever comes first, for better or worse\n[00:59.370]He's married to the game, like a fuck-you for Christmas\n[01:02.310]His gift is a curse, forget the earth, he's got\n[01:04.150]The urge to pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe\n[01:07.350]I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid\n[01:10.290]To take a stand, to take a stand\n[01:13.470]Everybody, everybody\n[01:15.960]Come take my hand, come take my hand\n[01:18.440]We'll walk this road together through the storm\n[01:21.850]Whatever weather, cold or warm\n[01:25.950]Just lettin' you know that you're not alone\n[01:27.450]Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road\n[01:29.940]Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit and cut the crap\n[01:32.700]I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a rap\n[01:35.940]You said you was the king, you lied through your teeth\n[01:38.500]For that fuck your fillings, instead of getting crowned you're getting capped\n[01:42.050]And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back\n[01:44.790]I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact\n[01:47.590]Let's be honest, that last \"Relapse\" CD, was \"eh\"\n[01:50.280]Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground\n[01:52.910]Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now\n[01:55.370]All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click clack, pow\n[01:57.850]'Cause I ain't playin' around, it's the game called circlin'\n[02:00.760]I don't know how, I'm way too up to back down\n[02:03.070]But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out\n[02:06.580]Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't\n[02:08.820]This fucking black cloud still follows me around\n[02:10.820]But it's time to exorcise these demons, these motherfuckers are doing jumping-jacks now\n[02:14.640]I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid\n[02:17.330]To take a stand, to take a stand\n[02:19.810]Everybody, everybody\n[02:22.990]Come take my hand, come take my hand\n[02:25.740]We'll walk this road together through the storm\n[02:29.420]Whatever weather, cold or warm\n[02:31.490]Just lettin' you know that you're not alone\n[02:34.550]Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road\n[02:37.510]And I just can't keep living this way\n[02:41.750]So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage\n[02:49.540]I'm standing up, I'ma face my demons\n[02:51.180]I'm manning up, I'ma hold my ground\n[02:53.610]I've had enough, now I'm so fed up\n[02:56.410]Tryin' to put my life back together right now\n[02:59.950]It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me\n[03:01.590]Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally for you\n[03:04.970]So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through\n[03:08.780]And don't even realize what you did, believe me you\n[03:11.570]I've been through the ringer, but take it through little to the middle finger\n[03:14.720]I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of\n[03:17.780]My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers\n[03:21.250]And drop dead, no more beef flingers\n[03:23.330]No more drama, from now I wanna promise to focus only\n[03:26.600]On handlin' my responsibilities as a father\n[03:27.850]So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters\n[03:30.860]And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it\n[03:33.440]'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club\n[03:35.120]Or the corner club and lift the whole liquour counter up\n[03:38.550]'Cause I'm raisin' the bar, I shoot for the moon\n[03:42.070]But I'm too busy gazin' at stars I feel amazin'\n[03:44.660]And I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid\n[03:46.870]To take a stand, to take a stand\n[03:49.640]Everybody, everybody\n[03:52.350]Come take my hand, come take my hand\n[03:55.360]We'll walk this route together through the storm\n[03:58.020]Whatever weather, cold or warm\n[04:00.750]Just lettin' you know that you're not alone\n[04:03.770]Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road\n[04:07.520]", "Comments":
