What's wrong with you?\n[00:30.08]You angrily tell me that I'm late\n[00:34.55]Well, I'm sorry but I did my best and running at my fastest pace\n[00:39.57]My heart overtook my body as it flew to find you in this place\n[00:45.27]Seeing your hair flowing and your bright eyes glowing aches my very core\n[00:50.29]Wish I could breathe in the same dimension I don't want to let it go\n[00:54.93]Now that I am finally faced with the voice I've known for so long\n[01:00.14]I don't know what the words should be the very first I say to you\n[01:07.46]Back in the zenzenzense until this day been looking everywhere for you\n[01:12.11]I follow the sound of your innocent laughter and it guided me in the right way\n[01:17.45]Even if every piece of you disappeared and if it scattered everywhere\n[01:22.11]No I wouldn't waver, I would start back at one, look for you all over again\n[01:27.21]Or maybe instead I'll take the whole universe right back to zero again\n[01:43.14]Where should I start? How should I explain?\n[01:47.49]Wanna tell you everything that happened while you were in a long long dream\n[01:53.21]I flew through dozens of skies\n[01:57.38]to tell you adventures I've been through hundreds of millions of light-years' worth\n[02:02.46]But now I'm here finally seeing you reflected in my eyes\n[02:07.98]I just want to know you ,play around and show you who it is that you can be\n[02:13.28]I just want to love you, every fragment of you right down to the pain you feel\n[02:17.99]Now that we have finally met at many galaxies' end\n[02:23.20]I don't know how to hold your hand so that I don't break it\n[02:30.31]Back in the Zenzenzense until this day been looking everywhere for you\n[02:35.05]Oh, I let the sound of your unfettered voice and the shedding of tears lead me this way\n[02:40.37]So tell me, who will ever gonna stop us on this \"the eve of our revolution\"\n[02:45.18]No more hesitation, I will put up a flag to stake my claim on your heart tonight\n[02:50.16]'Cause you took away from me the will to give up so clearly and awkwardly\n[02:56.05]Whoa~~\n[03:15.85]I wonder if we can push our way through\n[03:20.38]the countless barriers that's waiting in the future just beyond our view\n[03:26.18]Side by side, no way we can lose\n[03:30.56]We'll beat destiny at its own game and make it follow our own rules\n[03:35.55]And there isn't any weapon besides you that I need to use\n[03:44.42]Zenzenzense 'til this day been looking everywhere for you\n[03:48.65]I follow the sound of your innocent laughter and it guided me in the right way\n[03:53.98]Even if every piece of you disappeared and if it scattered everywhere\n[03:58.70]No, I won't waver. I will start back at one, look for you all over again\n[04:03.86]For millions of light-years yet to come with a verse on my lips that will never end", "Comments": 4590, "Mp3Url": "https://m8.music.126.net/20170619183129/7c5bc658281eba60e7681ce597046358/ymusic/50a8/ba76/a285/b08039269bb3b10196aee45699ef42e9.mp3", "AlbumPic": "https://p1.music.126.net/1Yr9BjOSnpv2RZco5uGkvg==/18678503535004895.jpg"}
