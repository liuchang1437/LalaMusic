restore the impression you have on my country, China,\n[00:13.89]which have been exactly fabricated by media for a long time\n[00:17.53]As an individual citizen based in south west of the country,\n[00:21.00]i wanna speak it then\n[00:22.63]You guys can know better about what the truth is and\n[00:24.93]how Chinese people assess their own country\n[00:26.89]and how much we don\u2019t wanna be disputants\n[00:28.55]First things first, we all know that China is a developing country\n[00:31.79]it has large population and it is really hard to manage\n[00:34.31]especially after world war 2, almost perished\n[00:36.92]i mean what i say is true, war is always scary\n[00:39.59]it is real that the pollution is severe at the present stage\n[00:42.27]in big cities like Beijing, Tianjin\n[00:44.13]Always pollution haze\n[00:45.18]Similar to 1950s, London and LA\n[00:47.70]It\u2019s painful with higher growth rate, you see?\n[00:49.87]People are too busy with business\n[00:51.27]everybody wanna have a better life\n[00:53.09]Make money, get married\n[00:54.49]But they are like the first or sec. generation of rich\n[00:57.22]not well-educated\n[00:58.24]But

peaceful place\n[01:19.60]The beautiful land with rich culture remain\n[01:22.10]At the second verse\n[01:23.11]It's really painful to point out the problems as they are too much for us to even think about and mention\n[01:27.87]The food & drug security event\n[01:28.99]Melamine Milk had affected 40 thousand babies and they all suffered from malnutrition\n[01:32.87]What's more, there was the Vaccination issue.\n[01:35.09]Illegal business operation has caused expiration and led to The panic in domestic\n[01:39.70]What's wrong with the businessmen\n[01:41.00]and it's reasonless to do business riding on them babies\n[01:43.57]the question is there were still somebody who wanted the situation to be worse\n[01:46.95]And their name is\n[01:47.60]you know who\n[01:48.24]They will get US Dollar perks\n[01:49.71]The Spy, the traitor, the liar and the money making jerks\n[01:52.05]They are leading the public into another extreme and it worked\n[01:54.45]Also it is shameful to talk about some politicians\n[01:57.02]because of their corruption and malversation in bidding sessions\n[01:59.25]Their sexual pics and the prostitution scandals\n[02:01.83]are all as a disgrace to the country and its people\n[02:04.86]You are prolly also confused about the situation of Taiwan\n[02:07.69]as you don't know the relationships between it and mainland\n[02:10.18]Actually, for normal citizens, we just want us to be united as one\n[02:12.85]cuz we think we are from one family, the same.\n[02:17.60]This is China\n[02:18.45]We love the country\uff0cwe the Chi-phenomena\n[02:21.17]The

things to deal with\n[02:39.69]We've made a progress and we are trying to prevent these happening\n[02:42.32]The power of Chinese people in China are gradually proving\n[02:45.15]that we can make a

the doctors\n[02:54.25]We don't have to wait in line and try so hard, cost so much to just pay to register\n[02:57.89]Meanwhile, we can trust the public security\n[02:59.86]cuz the policemen are kind to citizens but crucial to our enemies\n[03:03.15]We have tight gun control laws and we don't fear gun slaughtering\n[03:06.18]cuz only cops and soldiers are able to touch it\n[03:08.56]As for
