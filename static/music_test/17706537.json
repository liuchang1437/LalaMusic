Will I ever feel again?\n[01:08.710]\n[01:09.570]I'm a silhouette chasing rainbows on my own\n[01:16.820]But the more I try to move on, the more I feel alone\n[01:23.920]So I watch the summer stars to lead me home\n[01:28.500]\n[01:42.130]I'm sick of the past I can't erase\n[01:49.900]A jumble of footprints and hasty steps I can't replace\n[01:55.830]The mountain of things I still regret\n[02:02.510]Is a vile reminder that I would rather just forget \uff08no matter where I go\uff09\n[02:09.139]\n[02:09.919]The fire I began is burning me alive\n[02:16.350]But I know better than to leave and let it die\n[02:22.790]I'm a silhouette asking every now and then\n[02:28.920]Is it over yet?
