bitch\n[00:03.280]Rat a tat tat\n[00:04.210]Rat a tat tat tat hey\n[00:06.040]No thesis existed for burning cities down\n[00:08.100]at such a rampant rate\n[00:09.160]No graphics and no fucking\n[00:10.600]Powerpoint presentation\n[00:12.170]So they just DIY'd that shit\n[00:13.790]and they built their own bombs\n[00:15.100]She's his suicide blond,\n[00:16.230]she's number than gold\n[00:17.700]Are you ready for another bad poem?\n[00:20.700]\n[00:21.380]One more off key anthem\n[00:24.000]Let your teeth sink in\n[00:26.000]\n[00:26.620]Remember me as I was not as I am\n[00:30.870]And I said \"I'll check in tomorrow\n[00:33.860]\n[00:35.180]if I don't wake up dead,\"\n[00:37.200]I kept wishing she had blonde ambition\n[00:39.580]and she'd let it go to my head\n[00:41.950]\n[00:42.760]Rat a tat tat\n[00:43.890]Rat a tat tat tat hey\n[00:45.700]If my love is a weapon\n[00:46.950]There's no second guessing when I say\n[00:48.630]Rat a tat tat\n[00:49.440]Rat a tat tat tat hey\n[00:51.110]If my heart is a grenade\n[00:52.360]You pull the pin and say:\n[00:53.740]We're all fighting growing old\n[00:56.130]\n[00:56.690]We're all fighting growing old\n[00:59.310]In the hopes\n[01:00.460]\n[01:02.150]Of a few minutes more\n[01:04.930]To get on St. Peter's list\n[01:08.870]But you need to lower your standards\n[01:11.740]\n[01:13.430]Cause it's never\n[01:14.420]\n[01:15.240]Getting any better than this\n[01:16.780]We are professional ashes of roses\n[01:18.660]This kerosene's live\n[01:19.970]You settled your score\n[01:21.060]This is where you come to beg,\n[01:22.310]unborn and unshaven\n[01:23.430]Killing fields of fire to a congress of ravens\n[01:26.000]This is what we do, baby,\n[01:27.050]we nightmare you\n[01:28.190]I'm about to make\n[01:29.070]the sweat roll backwards\n[01:31.630]And your heart beat in reverse\n[01:34.370]Our guts can't be reworked\n[01:36.750]As alone as a little white church\n[01:39.120]In the middle of the desert getting burned\n[01:41.360]But I'll take your heart\n[01:43.850]served up two ways\n[01:45.580]I sing a bitter song\n[01:48.020]I'm the lonelier version of you\n[01:50.330]I just don't know where it went wrong\n[01:52.510]\n[01:53.320]Rat a tat tat\n[01:54.260]Rat a tat tat tat hey\n[01:56.200]If my love is a weapon\n[01:57.150]There's no second guessing when I say\n[01:59.290]Rat a tat tat\n[02:00.150]Rat a tat tat tat hey\n[02:01.520]If my heart is a grenade\n[02:03.030]You pull the pin and

young dirty blonde\n[02:52.360]And you sink inside her\n[02:53.690]like a suicide bomb\n[02:54.980]He says \"I've seen bigger\"\n[02:56.670]She says \"I've lit better\"\n[02:58.350]And they throw the matches down into the glitter\n[03:00.660]\n[03:01.280]Not a dry eye left in the house\n[03:03.900]Go boy, go boy, run for your life\n[03:06.650]Go boy, go boy, run for your life\n[03:09.520]Go boy,
