Long live the king!\"\n[00:54.450]One minute I held the key\n[00:58.070]Next the walls were closed on me\n[01:01.160]And I discovered that my castles stand\n[01:05.060]Upon pillars of salt, pillars of sand\n[01:08.090]\n[01:08.940]I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing\n[01:12.550]Roman Cavalry choirs are singing\n[01:16.130]Be my mirror my sword and shield\n[01:19.550]My missionaries in a foreign field\n[01:23.100]For some reason I can not explain\n[01:26.500]Once you go there was never, never an honest word\n[01:32.960]That was when I ruled the world\n[01:38.590]\n[01:50.180]It was the wicked and wild wind\n[01:55.870]Blew down the doors to let me in.\n[01:58.280]Shattered windows and the sound of drums\n[02:02.230]People could not believe what I'd become\n[02:04.130]Revolutionaries Wait\n[02:09.070]For my head on a silver plate\n[02:12.240]Just a puppet on a lonely string\n[02:16.280]Oh who would ever want to be king?\n[02:18.870]\n[02:20.280]I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing\n[02:23.670]Roman Cavalry choirs are singing\n[02:27.190]Be my mirror my sword and shield\n[02:30.670]My missionaries in a foreign field\n[02:35.300]For some reason I can not explain\n[02:37.920]I know Saint Peter won't call my name\n[02:40.820]Never an honest word\n[02:43.670]But that was when I ruled the world\n[02:48.270]\n[03:00.660](Ohhhhh Ohhh Ohhh)\n[03:16.040]Hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing\n[03:19.060]Roman Cavalry choirs are singing\n[03:22.490]Be my mirror my sword and shield\n[03:25.850]My missionaries in a foreign field\n[03:29.420]For some reason I can not explain\n[03:32.840]I know Saint Peter won't call my name\n[03:36.340]Never an honest word\n[03:39.280]But that was when I ruled the world\n[03:43.470]", "Comments": 51645, "Mp3Url": "http://m8.music.126.net/20170619204352/e471a418bb7769b1c32fe62b173423df/ymusic/ca8a/7a94/5119/9e475865b18280295411cf5e4114f322.mp3", "AlbumPic": "https://p1.music.126.net/Wr13D68yaaknFmxTD5xnoQ==/18569651881855121.jpg"}
