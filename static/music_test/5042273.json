That it's namin'.\n\n[00:58.80]For the loser now.Will be later to win.\n\n[01:02.57]For the times they are a-changin'.\n\n[01:19.07]Come senators, congressmen.Please heed the call.\n\n[01:23.90]Don't stand in the doorway.Don't block up the hall.\n\n[01:28.25]For he that gets hurt.Will be he who has stalled.\n\n[01:33.01]There's a battle outside.And it is ragin'.\n\n[01:37.32]It'll soon shake your windows.And rattle your walls.\n\n[01:41.47]For the times they are a-changin'.\n\n[01:51.89]Come mothers and fathers.Throughout the land.\n\n[01:56.97]And don't criticize.What you can't understand.\n\n[02:01.49]Your sons and your daughters.Are beyond your command.\n\n[02:06.15]Your old road is.Rapidly agin'.\n\n[02:10.47]Please get out of the new one.If you can't lend your hand.\n\n[02:14.70]For the times they are a-changin'.\n\n[02:36.65]The line it is drawn.The curse it is cast.\n\n[02:41.56]The slow one now.Will later be fast.As the present now.\n\n[02:47.84]Will later be past.The order is\n\n[02:50.75]Rapidly fadin'.\n\n[02:54.81]And the first one now.\n\n[02:57.15]Will later be last For the times\n\n[03:01.06]they are a-changin'.\n", "Comments": 721, "Mp3Url": "http://m8.music.126.net/20170619005609/ee6bbae8e9d50efac80b912d6400888a/ymusic/9c4c/65c6/401e/7319d0c7999372700b8cbae8a472a3cb.mp3", "AlbumPic": "https://p1.music.126.net/5QewaPSYQ7HgoC0zKDYHMA==/2534374302689297.jpg"}
