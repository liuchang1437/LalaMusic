But first, I gotta\nBang bang, the boogie to the boogie,\nSay up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie,\nLet's rock, you don't stop,\nRock the rhythm that'll make your body rock.\nWell so far you've heard my voice but I brought two friends along,\nAnd the next on the mic is my man Hank,\nC'mon, Hank, sing that song!\n\nCheck it out, I'm the C-A-S-A, the N-O-V-A,\nAnd the rest is F-L-Y,\nYou see I go by the code of the doctor of the mix,\nAnd these reasons I'll tell you why.\nYou see, I'm six foot one, and I'm tons of fun\nWhen I dress to a T,\nYou see, I got more clothes than Muhammad Ali\nand I dress so viciously.\nI got bodyguards, I got two big cars\nThat definitely ain't the wack,\nI got a Lincoln Continental and a sunfoofed Cadillac.\nSo after school I take a dip in the pool,\nWhich is really on the wall,\nI got a colour TV, so I can see\nThe Knicks play basketball. Hear me talk about\nCheckbooks, credit cards, mo' money\nThan a sucker could ever spend,\nBut I wouldn't give a sucker or a bum form the Rucker\nNot a dime 'til I made it again. Everybody go\nHo-tel, Mo-tel, Whatcha gonna do today? (Say what?)\n'Cos I'm a get a fly girl,\nGonna get some spank n' drive off in a def OJ.

(Say what?)\nI'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank, drive off in a def OJ,\nEverybody go, \"Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn\"\nYou say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friend\nI say skip, dive, what can I say?\nI can't fit 'em all inside my OJ,\nSo I just tak half, and bust 'em out,\nI give the rest to Master Gee so he can shock the house\nIt was twelve o'clock one Friday night\nI was rockin' to the beat and feelin' all right\nEverybody was dancin' on the floor\nDoin' all the things they never did before\nAnd then this fly girl with a sexy lean\nShe came into the bar, she came into the scene\nShe travelled deeper inside the room\nAll the fellas checked out her white Sassoons\nShe came up to the table, looked into my eyes\nThen she turned around and shook her behind\nSo I said to myself, it's time for me to release\nMy vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece\nAnd now people in the house, this is just for you\nA little rap to make you boogaloo\nNow the group you hear is called Phase Two\nAnd let me tell you somethin', we're a helluva crew\nOnce a week, we're on the street\nJust to cut in the jams and look at your feet\nFor you to party, you gotta have the moves,\nSo we'll get right down and get you a groove \nFor you to dance, you got to be hot\nSo we'll get right down and make you rock\nNow the system's on and the girls are there\nYou definitely have a rockin' affair\nBut let me tell you somethin', there's still one fact\nAnd to have a party, you got to have a rap\nSo when the party's over, you're makin' it home,\nAnd tryin' to sleep before the break of dawn\nAnd while you're sleepin', you start to dream,\nAnd thinkin' how you danced on the disco scene\nMy name appears in your mind,\nYeah, a name you know that was right on time\nIt was Phase Two just doin' a do\nRockin' you down 'cos you knew we could\nTo the rhythm of the beat that makes you freak,\nCome alive girls, get on your feet\nTo the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat\nTo the double beat beat that makes you freak\nTo the rhythm of the beat that says you go on\nOn'n'on into the break of dawn\nNow I got a man comin' on right now\nHe's garuanteed to throw down\nHe goes by the name of Wonder Mike\nCome on, Wonder Mike, do what you like!\n\nI say a can of beer that's sweeter than honey,\nLike a millionaire that has no money\nLike a rainy day that is not wet,\nLike a gamblin' fiend that does not bet\nLike Dracula without his fangs,\nLike the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang\nLike collard greens that don't taste good,\nLike a tree that's not made out of wood\nLike goin' up and not comin' down,\nIs just like the beat without the sound, no sound\nTo the beat beat, you do the freak\nEverybody just rock and dance to the beat\nHave you ever went over a friends house to eat\nAnd the food just ain't no good?\nThe macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed,\nAnd the chicken tastes like wood\nSo you try to play it off like you think you can\nBy saying that you're full\nAnd then your friend says, \"Mama, he's just being polite\nHe ain't finished, uh-uh, that's bull!\"\nSo your heart starts pumpin' and you think of a lie\nAnd you say that you already ate\nAnd your friend says \"Man, there's plenty of food\"\nSo you pile some more on your plate\nWhile the stinky food's steamin', your mind starts to dreamin'\nOf the moment that it's time to leave\nAnd then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rottin'\nInto something that looks like cheese\nOh so you say \"That's it, I gotta leave this place\nI don't care what these people think,\nI'm just sittin' here makin' myself nauseous\nWith this ugly food that stinks\"\nSo you bust out the door while it's still closed\nStill sick from the food you ate\nAnd then you run to the store for quick relief\nFrom a bottle of Kaopectate\nAnd then you call your friend two weeks later\nTo see how he has been\nAnd he says, \"I understand about the food,\nBaby Bubba, but we're still friends\"\nWith a hip hop the hippie to the hippie\nThe hip hip a hop, a you don't stop the rockin'\nTo the bang bang boogie\nSay up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie the beat\nI say, \"Hank, can ya rock?\nCan ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop?\nCan ya hip me to the shoobie doo?\"\nI said, \"Come on, make, make the people move!\"\n\nI go to the balls and then ring the bell\nBecause I am the man with the clientele\nAnd if ya ask me why I rock so well,\nA Big Bang, I got clientele\nAnd from the time I was only six years old\nI never forgot what I was told\nIt was the best advice I ever had\nIt came from my wise, dear old dad\nHe said, \"Sit down, punk, I wanna talk to you\nAnd don't say a word until I'm through\nNow there's a time to laugh, a time to cry\nA time to live and a time to die\nA time to break and a time to chill\nTo act civilized or act real ill\nBut whatever you do in your lifetime\nYou never let an MC steal your rhyme\"\nSo from six to six 'til this very day\nI'll always remember what he had to say\nSo when the sucker MCs try to chump my style\nI let them know that I'm versatile\nI got style, finesse, and a little black book\nThat's filled with rhymes and I know you wanna look\nBut the thing that seperates you from me\nAnd that is called originality\nBecause my rhymes are on from what you heard\nI didn't even bite, not a go---word\nAnd I say a little more, later on tonight\nSo the sucker MCs can bite all night\nA tick a tock, y'all, a beat beat, y'all\nA let's rock, y'all, you don't stop\nYa go, \"Ho-tel, mo-tel, whatcha gonna do today?\" (Say what?)\nYa say, \"I'm gonna get a fly girl, gonna get some spank and\n\nDrive off in a def OJ\"\nEverybody go, \"Ho-tel, mo-tel, Holiday Inn\"\nYa say if your girl starts actin' up, then you take her friends\nA like that, y'all, to the beat, y'all\nBeat beat y'all, ya don't stop!\nA Master Gee, my mellow\nIt's on to you so whatcha gonna do?\n\nWell, like Johnny Carson on the Late Show\nA like Frankie Crocker in stereo\nWell like the Barkay's singin' \"Holy Ghost\"\nThe sounds to throw down, they're played the most\nIt's like my man Captain Sky\nWhose name he earned with his super sperm\nWe rock and we don't stop\nGet off, y'all, I'm here to give you whatcha got\nTo the beat that it makes you freak\nAnd come alive, girl, get on your feet\nA like a Perry Mason without a case\nLike Farrah Fawcett without her face\nLike the Barkays on the mic\nLike gettin' down right for you tonight\nLike movin' your body so you don't know how\nRight to the rhythm and throw down\nLike comin' alive to the Master Gee\nThe brother who rocks so viciously\nI said the age of one, my life begun\nAt the age of two I was doin' the do\nAt the age of three, it was you and me\nRockin' to the sounds of the Master Gee\nAt the age of four, I was on the floor\nGivin' all the freaks what they bargained for\nAt the age of five I didn't take no jive\nWith the Master Gee it's all the way live\nAt the age of six I was a-pickin' up sticks\nRappin' to the beat, my stick was fixed\nAt the age of seven, I was rockin' in heaven\nDon'tcha know I went off\nI gotta run on down to the beat you see\nGettin' right on down, makin' all the girls\nJust take off their clothes to the beat the beat\nTo the double beat beat that makes you freak\nAt the age of eight, I was really great\n'Cause every night, you see, I had a date\nAt the age of nine, I was right on time\n'Cause every night I had a party rhyme\nGoing on'n'n'on'n' on on'n'on\nThe beat don't stop until the break of dawn\nA sayin' on'n'n'on'n' on on'n'on\nLike a hot buttered de pop pop de popcorn...", "Comments": 352, "Mp3Url":
