Life could be beautiful\n[00:55.890]for anybody it is for,\n[01:00.760]The portal has been past\n[01:05.680]to follow the reaper\n[01:32.820]When your blindly death-raying blade\n[01:35.840]sweeps the griefs and fears away.\n[01:38.140]I cross my heart\n[01:40.160]I cross my heart\n[01:43.140]Sinking down in the ocean of severe emotions.\n[01:48.110]Grab a bottle to drink up the pain-reliefing potion.\n[01:53.540]But after all, that got boring too,\n[01:57.940]so no matter,what happens, I could not give a damn or too.\n[02:33.350]The portal has been past til the point of no return.\n[02:38.140]No more lines to cross,\n[02:39.320]no bridges to burn.\n[03:32.440]Now when your blindly death-raying blade\n[03:35.600]swept my griefs and tears away.\n[03:38.070]I would never go back to cross that line.\n[03:40.370]I cross my heart and hope to die.\n[03:45.540]speaking  I was only 21 when I died.", "Comments": 258, "Mp3Url": "https://m8.music.126.net/20170620020040/6e5e8df92b7fa0cd4661fbbbb33575f4/ymusic/7b70/af12/3d12/d02fe5637f68f64ac6a19dd71d9ccc01.mp3", "AlbumPic": "https://p1.music.126.net/9YXySTz3ez4Zf5e0HIcVlA==/2536573325426942.jpg"}
