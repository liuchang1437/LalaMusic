Yes.\n[00:55.870]But when I saw her,\n[00:57.100]the only thing I could think about was the hairpin curve of her lips\n[00:59.830]Or the eyelash on her cheek\n[01:01.710]The eyelash on her cheek\n[01:02.520]The eyelash on her cheek.\n[01:03.990]\n[01:05.270]I knew I had to talk to her.\n[01:08.030]I asked her out six times in thirty seconds.\n[01:11.420]She said yes after the 3rd one,\n[01:12.980]But none of them felt right,\n[01:14.000]So I had to keep going.\n[01:15.370]\n[01:15.580]On our first date\n[01:16.540]I spent more time organizing my meal by color than I did eating it\n[01:20.500]or talking to her\n[01:21.530]\n[01:22.060]But she loved it\n[01:24.070]\n[01:24.320]She loved that I had to kiss her goodbye sixteen times or\n[01:26.360]twenty-four times if it was Wednesday\n[01:28.080]She loved that it took me forever to walk home\n[01:30.200]Because there are lots of cracks on our sidewalk\n[01:33.020]\n[01:33.540]When we moved in together, she said she felt safe\n[01:35.600]like no one would ever rob us because\n[01:37.320]I definitely locked the door eighteen times\n[01:40.170]\n[01:41.300]She close her eyes\n[01:42.260]And imagine days and nights what passing infact.\n[01:45.080]\n[02:55.610]When she said she loved me\n[02:56.760]Her mouth was a straight line.\n[02:58.250]\n[02:58.550]She told me that I was taking up too much of her time.\n[03:01.190]\n[03:01.650]Last week she started sleeping at her mother\u2019s place.\n[03:04.180]She told me that she shouldn\u2019t have let me get so attached to her\n[03:07.010]that this whole thing was a mistake\n[03:09.000]\n[03:09.370]But how can it be a mistake that I don\u2019t have to wash my hands\n[03:11.390]after I touched her?\n[03:12.900]\n[03:13.200]Love is not a mistake\n[03:15.190]\n[03:15.450]It\u2019s killing me\n[03:16.500]that she can run away from this and I just can\u2019t.\n[03:19.430]\n[03:19.580]I can\u2019tgo out and find someone new because I always think of her.\n[03:23.140]Usually, when I obsess over things\n[03:25.340]I see germs sneaking into my skin.\n[03:27.770]\n[03:28.050]I see myself crushed by an endless succession of cars.\n[03:31.050]And she was the first beautiful thing I ever got stuck on\n[03:34.990]\n[03:35.170]I want to wake up every morning\n[03:37.010]Thinking about the way she holds her steering wheel\n[03:38.980]How she turns shower knobs like she's opening a safe\n[03:41.900]How she blows out candles\n[03:42.920]Blows out candles\n[03:43.760]Blows out candles\n[03:44.390]Blows out candles\n[03:45.170]Blows out candles\n[03:45.990]Blows out the candles.blows out\u2026\n[03:48.180]\n[03:49.390]Now, I just think about who else is kissing her.\n[03:52.420]I can\u2019t breathe because he only kisses her once\n[03:54.730]He doesn\u2019t care if it\u2019s perfect!\n[03:56.370]\n[03:56.600]I want her back, So Bad!\n[03:59.500]\n[04:00.490]I leave the door unlocked.\n[04:01.640]\n[04:03.510]I leave the lights on.\n[04:04.250]\n[04:50.560]Change,right\n[04:51.400]\n[04:51.960]When I be imagined to change two things\n[04:54.420]Listen and speak up", "Comments": 799, "Mp3Url": "https://m8.music.126.net/20170619113701/1e25bb2d472dcbb307b2258cb6dbd852/ymusic/05b6/e956/2823/7d66654ccd59198fb8f869dfa417de38.mp3", "AlbumPic": "https://p1.music.126.net/YY9xgX2nV7PvvE8bBxzPaw==/2912606303981740.jpg"}
