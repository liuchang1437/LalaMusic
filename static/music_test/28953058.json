la\n[00:12.40]\n[00:53.29]I met this girl, late last year\n[00:55.41]She said don't you worry\n[00:56.65]if I disappear\n[00:57.83]I told her I'm not really looking\n[00:59.13]for another mistake\n[01:00.28]Call an old friend thinking\n[01:01.51]that the trouble would wait\n[01:02.82]And then I jump\n[01:03.54]right in a week later in turn\n[01:05.40]A record she was\n[01:06.15]only looking for a lover to burn\n[01:07.96]But I gave her my time,\n[01:09.44]for two or three nights\n[01:10.48]Then I put it on pause\n[01:11.70]until the moment was right\n[01:12.98]And then I wait 4 months\n[01:15.25]until our paths crossed again\n[01:17.46]\n[01:18.00]She told me I was never looking\n[01:19.32]for a friend\n[01:20.25]Maybe you can swing\n[01:21.31]by my room around 10\n[01:22.72]Baby bring the lemon\n[01:23.78]and a bottle of gin\n[01:25.11]We'll be in the sheets\n[01:26.09]till the late a.m.\n[01:27.66]Baby if you wanted me\n[01:28.80]you should've just said\n[01:30.12]She singing I like them la la\n[01:32.37]Don't fuck with my love\n[01:33.81]\n[01:34.59]That heart is so cold\n[01:36.32]\n[01:37.03]All over my arms\n[01:39.03]I don't wanna know that babe\n[01:41.21]I like them la la\n[01:42.37]Don't fuck with my love\n[01:43.89]\n[01:44.64]I told her she knows\n[01:46.57]\n[01:47.17]Take aim and reload\n[01:48.96]\n[01:49.50]I don't wanna know that babe\n[01:51.50]I like them la la\n[01:53.24]And for a couple weeks\n[01:54.18]I only wanna see her\n[01:55.68]We drink away the days\n[01:56.73]with a take away pizza\n[01:57.99]Before a text message\n[01:59.17]was the only way to reach her\n[02:00.71]Now she's staying at my place\n[02:01.94]and loves the way I treat her\n[02:03.28]Swinging at a reaper\n[02:04.44]Fall over the trap like a feature\n[02:06.30]Never wants to see that guess\n[02:07.47]I don't want to either\n[02:08.54]\n[02:09.16]But me and her we make money\n[02:10.39]the same way\n[02:11.46]4 cities, 2 planes the same day\n[02:14.21]And those shows\n[02:14.86]have never been\n[02:15.43]what it's about\n[02:16.15]Maybe we'll go together\n[02:17.38]and just figure it out\n[02:18.68]I'd rather put on a film with you\n[02:20.32]and sit on the couch\n[02:21.26]But we should get on a plane\n[02:22.51]or we'll be missing it now\n[02:23.74]We should've written it out,\n[02:24.94]the way things played out\n[02:26.15]She was kissing him out,\n[02:27.30]I was confused about\n[02:28.84]She should figure it out\n[02:30.05]while I'm sat here\n[02:31.08]Singing I like them la la\n[02:33.03]Don't fuck with my love\n[02:34.48]\n[02:35.20]That heart is so cold\n[02:36.82]\n[02:37.67]All over my arms\n[02:39.70]I don't wanna know that babe\n[02:41.80]I like them la la\n[02:43.00]Don't fuck with my love\n[02:44.46]\n[02:45.31]I told her she knows\n[02:47.10]\n[02:47.83]Take aim and reload\n[02:49.88]I don't wanna know that babe\n[02:52.03]I like them la la\n[02:54.08]\n[02:55.52]on my hotel door\n[02:56.27]\n[02:57.02]I don't even know if she knows what for\n[02:59.19]She was crying on my shoulder,\n[03:00.67]I already told ya\n[03:01.96]Trust and respect is what we do this for\n[03:04.42]I never intended to be next\n[03:06.05]\n[03:06.92]But you didn't need to take him to bed,\n[03:08.77]that's all\n[03:09.38]And I never saw him as a threat\n[03:11.13]\n[03:11.75]Until you disappeared\n[03:12.62]with him to have sex\n[03:13.86]Of course, it's not like\n[03:15.70]we were both on tour\n[03:16.95]We were staying on the same\n[03:18.31]fucking hotel floor\n[03:19.52]And I wasn't looking\n[03:20.29]for a promise or commitment\n[03:21.78]But it wasn't never just fun\n[03:23.18]and I thought you were different\n[03:24.85]This is not the way you realize\n[03:26.32]You wanted it's a bit too much\n[03:28.19]too late if I'm honest\n[03:29.49]All this time god knows I'm singing\n[03:32.26]I like them la la\n[03:33.61]Don't fuck with my love\n[03:35.08]\n[03:35.82]That
